    <h1>This specific bird is called a Rock Dove, 
        more commonly known in NY as a pigeon. It's 
        beautiful  iridesent feathers can be seen all 
        over the city, especially in Central Park where 
        they often walk up to you to beg for food.
        Most see a flock of pigeons as a hinderance, 
        however the tame nature of this bird is something 
        to recognize.
